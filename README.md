## Goal and Philosophy

`setup.sh` brings setup automation to everybody in a simple way. It should help
teams to customize the setup and create new ones easily.

**We encourage you to fork the project and add the apps that help you and your 
team to be productive and efficient.**

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/nshift/setup.sh
cd setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

*Note*: You can run `apps.sh`, `ios.sh` and `terminal.sh` separately but you 
should use `setup.sh` for most of the cases.

## Apps

Essential apps will be installed using [`mas-cli`](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas) 
and [`brew cask`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask).

These apps are perfect for being ready to get things done:

successor to iTerm.

by Apple for developing software for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

You can add or remove apps by editing `apps.sh`.
